## 🚀 GETTING STARTED

### Step 1: Read Summary (30 min)

```bash
# Open executive summary
open AUDIT_SUMMARY.md
# or
cat AUDIT_SUMMARY.md
```

**Understand:** What's wrong, why it matters, what to do

---

### Step 2: Review Findings (1-2 hours)

```bash
# Read detailed audit
open Physics-Audit.md
```

**Focus on:** Section 2 (Findings) and Section 3 (Summary)

**Goal:** Verify that issues are correctly identified

---

### Step 3: Plan Implementation (2-3 hours)

```bash
# Read correction plan
open ChangePlan.md
```

**Create:**
- Timeline (when will each patch be done?)
- Resource allocation (who implements?)
- Risk mitigation strategy

---

### Step 4: Set Up Testing (2-3 hours)

```bash
# Read validation plan
open ValidationPlan.md
```

**Implement:**
- Test infrastructure (pytest fixtures)
- Baseline capture script
- Energy monitoring

---

### Step 5: Execute First Patch (1 week)

**Follow:** ChangePlan.md Patch 1 (Euler kinematics)

**Steps:**
1. Implement `_body_rates_to_euler_rates()`
2. Write unit tests (from ValidationPlan.md Test 1.1.x)
3. Run integration test
4. Compare before/after plots
5. Commit changes

**Repeat** for remaining patches

| "Can I skip some patches?" | Minimum: 1,2,5 (frame+mass+restoring). Full physics: 1-7 |
| "What if I break something?" | Regression tests catch this (ValidationPlan.md p23) |
| "Where's the code to change?" | Each patch specifies files and line numbers |

### Still Stuck?

**Checklist:**
1. ✓ Read relevant section of Physics-Audit.md for background
2. ✓ Check ChangePlan.md for implementation guidance
3. ✓ Review ValidationPlan.md for how to test
4. ✓ Look at code references (file:line numbers in audit)
5. ✓ Consult Fossen (2011) textbook for math details
