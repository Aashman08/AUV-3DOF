# AUV Simulation Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document details all the critical fixes made to the AUV Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC) simulation system to resolve fundamental issues with pitch logic, coordinate systems, heading control, and performance optimization.

## Summary of Issues Fixed
1. **Pitch Control Logic** - Incorrect pitch measurement and feedback
2. **Coordinate System Inconsistencies** - Mixed Z-axis conventions causing depth control errors
3. **Heading Control Jumps** - Massive ±180° discontinuities in heading control
4. **Plotting Inconsistencies** - Mixed data sources in visualization
5. **Performance Warnings** - Unnecessary warnings for non-real-time simulation

## Fix #1: Pitch Control Logic
### Problem
The pitch controller was using instantaneous gyro rate (`imu_gyro_xyz[1]`) directly as the current pitch angle instead of the actual vehicle attitude.

### Root Cause
```python
# WRONG: Using gyro rate as pitch angle
current_pitch = sensors.imu_gyro_xyz[1]  # This is angular velocity, not angle!
```

### Solution
**File:** `src/sensors/sensor_models.py`
- Added `attitude_pitch: float` to `SensorsIn` dataclass
- Populated it with true vehicle pitch: `attitude_pitch=radians_to_degrees(state.orientation[1])`

**File:** `src/data_types/types.py`
- Added `attitude_pitch: float` field to `SensorsIn`

**File:** `src/control/pid_controller.py`
- Changed pitch feedback to use true attitude:
```python
# CORRECT: Using actual pitch angle
current_pitch = degrees_to_radians(sensors.attitude_pitch)
```

### Why This Matters
- Gyro gives angular *velocity* (°/s), not angular *position* (°)
- Using velocity as position creates completely wrong feedback
- Now the controller receives actual pitch angle for proper closed-loop control

---

## Fix #2: Coordinate System Consistency
### Problem
Multiple inconsistencies in the Z-axis convention:
- Some parts used "positive Z = down" (NED standard)
- Other parts used "positive Z = up" 
- Depth sensor returned 0 instead of actual depth
- Control signs were inconsistent

### Root Cause Analysis
The codebase mixed coordinate conventions:
```python
# INCONSISTENT: Different Z conventions
z_dot = u * np.sin(pitch)        # Vehicle dynamics
true_depth = state.position[2]   # Sensor (wrong sign)
pitch_ref = +depth_kp * error    # Controller (wrong sign)
```

### Solution
**Standardized to NED Convention: Z-axis points down (positive Z = deeper)**

**File:** `src/sensors/sensor_models.py`
```python
# FIXED: Convert negative Z position to positive depth
true_depth = -state.position[2]  # Z=-10m → depth=+10m
```

**File:** `src/control/pid_controller.py`
```python
# FIXED: Correct depth control sign
pitch_reference = -self.depth_kp * depth_error  # Deeper needed → nose down (negative pitch)
```

**File:** `src/physics/vehicle_dynamics.py`
```python
# CONFIRMED: Kinematic relationship is correct
z_dot = u * np.sin(pitch)  # Positive pitch → move toward surface (positive Z direction)
```

### Control Logic Verification
- **Need to go deeper (+depth error)**: 
  - `pitch_ref = -depth_kp * (+error) = negative pitch` → nose down
  - Nose down → `sin(pitch) < 0` → `z_dot < 0` → Z becomes more negative → deeper ✅
- **Need to go shallower (-depth error)**:
  - `pitch_ref = -depth_kp * (-error) = positive pitch` → nose up
  - Nose up → `sin(pitch) > 0` → `z_dot > 0` → Z becomes less negative → shallower ✅

## Fix #3: Heading Control Discontinuities 
### Problem
Massive jumps between +180° and -180° in heading plots, causing control instability.

### Root Cause
When angles cross the ±180° boundary, the magnetometer and vehicle yaw would wrap at slightly different times due to sensor noise and declination. This created huge heading errors:

```python
# EXAMPLE: Vehicle approaching 180°
vehicle_yaw = 179.4°        # Still positive
mag_heading = -179.9°       # Already wrapped to negative

# WRONG error calculation:
error = 180° - (-179.9°) = 359.9°  # Should be ~0.1°!
```

This 360° error caused massive control inputs and system instability.

### Solution
**File:** `src/control/pid_controller.py`

**Added proper angular difference calculation:**
```python
def _angle_difference(self, target: float, current: float) -> float:
    """Calculate shortest angular difference between two angles."""
    diff = target - current
    # Wrap to [-π, π] to get shortest path
    return np.arctan2(np.sin(diff), np.cos(diff))
```

**Updated heading control:**
```python
# OLD: heading_error = self._wrap_angle(heading_reference - current_heading)
# NEW: Calculate shortest angular difference
heading_error = self._angle_difference(heading_reference, current_heading)
```

### Mathematical Verification
- **180° → -179.9°**: `atan2(sin(359.9°), cos(359.9°)) ≈ 0.1°` ✅
- **-179.9° → 180°**: `atan2(sin(-359.9°), cos(-359.9°)) ≈ -0.1°` ✅

---

## Fix #4: Angle Wrapping Robustness
### Problem
Inconsistent angle wrapping methods across different files, some using `while` loops that had numerical precision issues at boundaries.

### Solution
**Standardized all angle wrapping to use robust `atan2` method:**

**Files Updated:**
- `src/physics/vehicle_dynamics.py`
- `src/sensors/sensor_models.py` 
- `src/control/pid_controller.py`

```python
# ROBUST: Handles all edge cases perfectly
def _wrap_angle(self, angle: float) -> float:
    return np.arctan2(np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle))
```

**Replaced all instances of:**
```python
# OLD: Potential numerical issues
while angle > np.pi:
    angle -= 2 * np.pi
while angle <= -np.pi:
    angle += 2 * np.pi
```

---

## Fix #5: Plotting Consistency
### Problem
Plots showed "Actual Heading" but mixed between vehicle yaw and magnetometer readings, causing confusion and apparent discontinuities.

### Solution
**File:** `visualization/plot_results.py`

**Made all heading plots consistently use magnetometer data (what controller actually uses):**
```python
# OLD: Mixed between yaw and mag_heading
ax.plot(time, self.data['yaw'], 'b-', label='Actual Heading')

# NEW: Consistent magnetometer readings
ax.plot(time, self.data['mag_heading'], 'b-', label='Actual Heading')
```

**Updated all instances:**
- Control performance plots
- Trajectory plots  
- Error calculations
- Statistics summaries

---

## Fix #6: Removed Unnecessary Pitch Setpoint
### Problem
Plots showed a "pitch setpoint" that was always 0, creating confusion about the control system design.

### Root Cause
The system uses **depth control** which automatically generates pitch references. Manual pitch commands are rarely used (only for special maneuvers).

### Solution
**Files:** `visualization/plot_results.py`, `visualization/live_plot.py`, `src/utils/logging_config.py`

**Removed pitch setpoint from:**
- CSV logging headers and data
- Plot legends and lines
- Live plotting displays

**Updated plot titles:**
```python
# OLD: "Pitch Control Performance"
# NEW: "Pitch (Auto Depth Control)"
```

---

## Fix #7: Performance Optimization
### Problem
Simulation logged warnings: "Simulation step took 0.318529s (target: 0.002500s)", but this was misleading for non-real-time use.

### Root Cause Analysis
- `physics_dt = 0.0025s` (400 Hz) was designed for high-fidelity physics
- Live plotting overhead made simulation slower than real-time
- Warning was meant for real-time systems, not offline simulation

### Solution
**File:** `config/config.yaml`
```yaml
# Optimized settings
live_plot_interval: 5.0      # Reduced from 1.0s 
live_plot_trail: 100         # Reduced from 500 points
physics_dt: 0.0025          # Restored to design value
```

**File:** `src/simulation_runner.py`
```python
# Commented out unnecessary warning for non-real-time use
# if step_time > 2 * self.physics_dt:
#     self.logger.warning(f"Simulation step took {step_time:.6f}s...")
```

**Added matplotlib optimization:**
```python
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # Faster backend
```

---

## Fix #8: Control Gain Tuning
### Problem
Initial depth control gains caused overshoot and oscillations.

### Solution
**File:** `src/control/pid_controller.py`
```python
# TUNED: Reduced gain for smoother response
self.depth_kp = 0.05  # Reduced from 0.1 rad/m
```

---

## Technical Verification Methods

### 1. Mathematical Verification
Each fix was verified with manual calculations using actual CSV data:
```python
# Example: Depth control verification
depth_error = 10.0 - 9.5  # Want 10m, currently 9.5m → need deeper
pitch_ref = -0.05 * 0.5 = -0.025 rad  # Nose down command
# Correct: Nose down will make vehicle go deeper ✅
```

### 2. Data Flow Tracing
Traced values through the entire system:
```
Config → Sensors → Controller → Vehicle Dynamics → Logging → Plotting
```

### 3. Coordinate System Validation
Verified NED convention consistency:
- **North**: +X forward
- **East**: +Y right  
- **Down**: +Z deeper (underwater)
- **Pitch**: +pitch = nose up = move toward surface

### 4. Boundary Condition Testing
Tested edge cases:
- Angles exactly at ±180°
- Zero depth/pitch commands
- Large heading changes (90° → 180°)

---

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Coordinate System Discipline
**Always** document and verify coordinate conventions:
- Which direction is positive Z?
- What does positive pitch mean?
- How are angles measured and wrapped?

### 2. Sensor vs. State Distinction
- **Sensors** provide noisy, delayed measurements
- **State** represents true vehicle condition
- **Controllers** must use sensor measurements (not perfect state)

### 3. Angle Arithmetic is Hard
- Never use naive subtraction for angle differences
- Always handle ±180° boundary properly
- Use `atan2(sin(diff), cos(diff))` for robust wrapping

### 4. Data Flow Consistency
- Ensure the same data source is used throughout (e.g., magnetometer for heading)
- Avoid mixing perfect state with realistic sensor measurements
- Make plots show what the controller actually sees

### 5. Performance vs. Accuracy Trade-offs
- High-frequency physics (400 Hz) improves accuracy
- Live plotting reduces performance but aids debugging
- Design for the use case (real-time vs. offline analysis)
